Controllers use a mixture of scaffolding and custom code.
Scaffolding gsp templates are significantly different in v4 from v1.
Existing main css is all written for v1, and I want to retain the styles.

Options are therefore:

- Overhaul v4 templates to generate v1 code
  - Pro: hoped it would be straightforward
  - Con: it's a step in the wrong direction
  - Status: It's workable but not easy. install-templates gives you the outline, but
            the tags all need to be reworked too. Too much work for a retrograde step. Abandoned.

- Add controller & view code to scaffolded classes
  - Pro: probably quicker to change groovy code than css
  - Con: it's a step in the wrong direction
  - Status: Done for Category class. Laborious and error prone but seems functional. Try something else next.

- Use v1 styles for v1 code and v4 styles for v4 scaffolding
  - Pro: should be able to achieve good functionality with less work
  - Con: inconsistent look across different domain classes
  - Status: It's workable, but I mix scaffold and non-scaffold methods within controllers, so the
            switching between stylesheets in the main.gsp layout is a bit ugly. It's also not a
            completely clean division as headers & footers from the layout classes need styling.

- Overhaul CSS to work with v4 templates
  - Pro: more in keeping with an upgrade to v4
  - Con: lots of work required on styles, which is not what this project was about; I don't like the v4 styles anyway.
  - Status: probably the purest option, but more work than I want to do. TODO
